## [Project 1: News Categorization](https://github.com/gkdsc2020/dsc550_data_mining/blob/main/week10_final_project_GaneshKale.ipynb):

##### Background: 

For long time, this process of categorization news was done manually by people and used to allot news to respective section(category). With digitalization of news paper, the news gets updated every moment and allocating to them to appropriate category can be cumbersome task.

**How this problem was solved**: To avoid manual news categorization, with help of latest technology, Natural Language Processing and Machine Leanring, this problem is tackled to classify and predict which category a piece of news will fall into based on the news headline and short description.

**How this model would help news editors and customers?**

A machine learning model is built using supervised machine learning techniques, that learns from existing news headlines and short description and predict the news category appropriately. With the help of this model the news categorization can be automated and it would save manual work and help users to read the news of their interest in right section.

##### Modeling: 

Following machine learning classification algorithms were used to train and evaluate model.

- Naïve Bayes Classifier 
- Linear Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression
- XGBoost Classifier

##### Conclusion: 

XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework.
This model provided highes accuracy score among all of the three and is finalized as baseline model for this project.

## [Project 2: Walmart Sales Forecasting](https://github.com/gkdsc2020/dsc630_predictive_analytics/blob/main/dsc630_final_project.ipynb):

##### Background: 

Sales Forecasting is the process of using a company’s sales records over the past few years to predict the short-term or long-term sales performance of the company in the future. Sales forecasting is a globally conducted corporate practice where number of objectives are identified, action-plans are chalked out as well as budgets and resources are allotted to them.
Business Sales Executives often find themselves scrambling for answers when it comes to sales forecasting during business reviews. The Sales Forecast Model will help sales executives to find such answers upfront and be ready with numbers and predictions to share with leaderships team. 

#### Problem Statement:

The goal of this analysis is to predict future sales for the Walmart stores based on the varying features and events.

•	Build the Machine Learning model that would learn from past records, events and predict the accurate outcomes.

•	Predict the Sales forecast for Store and its departments on specific week of the year considering if it is before holiday or after holiday.

**How this model would help?**

The baselined model which produced best accuracy score can be used to predict the sales forecast for any given store and its departments. The model can be deployed to production system and simple application can be built to predict sales.

##### Modeling: 

These ML algorithms are used to train the model and evaluated using Weighted mean absolute error. The model with lowest RMSE score and best accuracy score is baselined. Following are the list of ML algorithms are used to train the model – 
•	KNN Regression	
•	Decision Tree
•	Random Forest
•	Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBoost Regressor)
•	ARIMA - Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average

#### Result:

##### Conclusion: 

Comparing the accuracy of different models, it turns out that XGBoost regressor with accuracy score 97.7% and Root Mean Squared Error 3463 is the best model for this project and is baselined. The model can be deployed to production system and simple application can be built to predict sales. The Application would accept values such store number, department number, week of the year, size of the store, is holiday in the week, average temperature, unemployment rate in that week, fuel price etc. and based on these values it would predict the sales value for that store and departments.

## [Project 3: Next Word Prediction-Language Model](https://github.com/gkdsc2020/dsc680-applied-ds/blob/main/dsc680_project1_GaneshKale.pdf):

##### Background: 

Language modeling involves predicting the next word in a sequence given the sequence of words already present. A language model is a key element in many natural language processing models such resolving customers inquiries through chat or answering the questions through emails.
In customer Service business especially in messaging or Chats or email supports, customer representative often struggle to response fast if they have limited knowledge of business area wherein the inquiry is about and need to respond fast for better service and improved customer satisfaction.


#### Problem Statement:

Business Stakeholder wanted to build model that would learn from previously provided chat or email resolution history and suggest the next word when representative start providing resolution to the customers inquiry.

• Build the model that would predict the next word based on previous context.

##### Modeling: 

The model is built using Recurrent neural networks (RNN) and TensorFlow and Keras.

Text data is cleaned and transformed in vector form using sklearns vecorizer. 

The sequential neural network model in trained using LSTM(Long-Short Term memory) network. It is a variety of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are capable of learning long-term dependencies, especially in sequence prediction problems.

##### Conclusion: 

The model is predicting the next words based on given input sample text, the generate next word or series of words can be handled through argument as configuration and changed based on model performance.
The next word prediction language model is generating the relevant word and can be used in production to help agent type response fast.

## [Project 4: Transaction Categorization](https://github.com/gkdsc2020/dsc680-applied-ds/blob/main/project2_transaction_categorization_GaneshKale.ipynb):

##### Background: 

Transaction categorization is the ability to recognize the purpose of a transaction based on its description. For long, this process was done manually but now technology can do it efficiently.
This project is focused on Natural Language Processing using the power of Machine Learning to predict which category a transaction will fall into, given the description of the transaction.

#### Problem Statement:

Goal - Build a model to predict transaction categories using the 10 (ten) distinct categories that a transaction may fall into. The categories are as follows:

1. Communication Services
2. Education
3. Entertainment
4. Finance
5. Health and Community Service
6. Property and Business Services
7. Retail Trade
8. Services to Transport
9. Trade, Professional and Personal Services
10. Travel

##### Modeling: 

The model is built using NLP and Classification Machine Learnings.
The text data is converted into vectors using sklearns countvecotrizer and then SMOTE technique is used to baance the target classes.
Below are the list of classifications algorithms are used - 

- Naïve Bayes Classifier
- Support Vector Machine
- XGBoost Classifier

**Model Summary:

Model       | Name	Accuracy Score

XGBoost	    | 69%

SVM	        | 69%

Naïve Bayes | 66%


##### Conclusion: 

After building and evaluating multiple classification models, we can see that the XGBoost has better accuracy which is 69% and since it uses gradient boosting it provides better result than other classifier models.

Based on this we can recommend XGBoost Classifier model as final model for our project to predict the transactions categories.
