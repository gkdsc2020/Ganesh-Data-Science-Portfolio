## [Project 1: News Categorization](https://github.com/gkdsc2020/dsc550_data_mining/blob/main/week10_final_project_GaneshKale.ipynb):
 
##### Background: 

For long time, this process of categorization news was done manually by people and used to allot news to respective section(category). With              digitalization of news paper, the news gets updated every moment and allocating to them to appropriate category can be cumbersome task.
 

**How this problem was solved**: To avoid manual news categorization, with help of latest technology, Natural Language Processing and Machine           Leanring, this problem is tackled to classify and predict which category a piece of news will fall into based on the news headline and short             description.
 
 
**How this model would help news editors and customers?**

A machine learning model is built using supervised machine learning techniques, that learns from existing news headlines and short description and       predict the news category appropriately. With the help of this model the news categorization can be automated and it would save manual work and help     users to read the news of their interest in right section.
 
 
##### Modeling: 

Following machine learning classification algorithms were used to train and evaluate model.

 - Naïve Bayes Classifier 
 - Linear Support Vector Machine
 - Logistic Regression
 - XGBoost Classifier

##### Conclusion: 

XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements machine              learning     algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework.

## [Project 6: Data Prep and EDA for Housing Price Prediction](https://github.com/gkdsc2020/dsc540_data_preperation/blob/main/Final_Project.ipynb):

##### Background: 

House Prices in USA are booming, and house prices will continue to race ahead, at nearly twice the pace predicted before this year. This is what we hear or read when talk about housing market in USA.
To make data ready by collecting from different sources and cleaning, transforming, and merging all these data to make it final dataset in the ready format for machine learning algorithms so predicting house price model can be developed by training and validating on housing market dataset. To build predicting house price model, we should consider different factors such as house information, and facilities available in neighborhood such school, hospitals etc. 

#### Data Sources:

As part of this project, Austin, Texas housing market data is collected from 3 difference sources such as csv file with house related information, json file for hospital in neighborhood and tabular data for school information from website.

- **CSV File**: Austin TX area house information, such as address, year built, sale price, No. of bedroom, bathrooms, lot area etc.
- **Tabular Data**: The neighborhood school information will be pulled from below websites, since the website has school information such as address,     type of school, student per teacher ratio, ratings and percentile, staar awards ratings etc. but we dont need grade level rating so we are going to     remove them and clean data and at last will be joined with main data set based in zipcode value.
- **Json File**: The neighborhood public health locations information is pulled from data.gov using API. The data is in json format, and it will have     public health locations information such as facility name, address, hours of operation, website etc. 


##### Conclusion: 

As part of this project, I have implemented all the data prep and EDA techniques to make final dataset in ready format so that it will be passed to ML algorithms to make house price prediction model. There are few features kept in the data set such as urls, owner names, address for information purpose and can be ignored before feeding to ML algorithms.

## [Project 7: Data Visualization]():

##### Background: 

Airline travel is most preferred one but with recent accidents, Media made hype about it and started bad publicity and tried prove that air travel is not safest way of travel. As airline compay employee, stakeholders and Leadership goup asked to perform analysis on this area and provide different kind of visualization to prove or disprove this statement made by media.

#### Problem Statement:

As media raised concern over air travel safety, as employee of airline company need to solve this problem thru visualization - 

- Is air travel safe?
- Are there any impact on airline profits due to bad publicity?

#### Tableau Dashboard:

The visualization dashboard was built for internal communication purpose to provide the facts about the airline travel is safe and there is no adverse impact because of negative publicity made by media that it is dangerous to travel.
This dashboard considers the historical data of worldwide airlines and fatal incidents, fatalities happened specific to airlines and in the year, also captured financial data to show that there is not impact on overall profit and public demand to airline travel.

##### [Blog Post](link):

The blog post is written with the help of data and charts those were presented in Dashboard. Since blog is for external audience in short for public so I made sure it gives some background about the research performed and what is the result of research and how we resolve the conflict of bad publicity by sharing the realistic data and figures.

##### [Infographics](https://github.com/gkdsc2020/dsc640_presentation_viz/blob/main/week9_10_Air%20Travel%20Safety%20Infographics.pdf):

Infographics are used to convey complicated data in a simple visual format. They are also visual tools to tell stories. Visual information graphics help people understand information quickly and more accurately. Since this topic was to convey message to public that airline is still safest way of travel, the infographics would provide them what them need to know from it.

 
##### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, we were able to clarify two things are:

- Airline travel is still safest way of travel.
- There is no impact on net profit and public demand of air travel is increasing and will improve sales.


## [Project 8: R - Predict House Prices in Austin TX](https://github.com/gkdsc2020/dsc520statfords/blob/main/dsc520_final_project.Rmd):

##### Background: 
House Prices in USA are booming and house prices will continue to race ahead, at nearly twice the pace predicted before this year. Buying house is very critical job, one should aware of lots of things before buying house and when buying house nobody sure about when is the right time to buy house and wants to have some tool that would consider all the factors determining house price and predict the house price. Predicting the house price is challenging but doable and with help of machine learning algorithms this can be achieved. 


#### Problem Statement:

To predict the house prices from given house features and area features, the main business problems are:

- Identify the features that impact house Price.
- Predict the house prices based on identified features.


##### Modeling: 

R provides comprehensive support for multiple linear regression, Multiple regression is an extension of linear regression into relationship between more than two variables. In simple linear relation we have one predictor and one response variable, but in multiple regression we have more than one predictor variable and one response variable.

**lm()** function creates the relationship model between the predictor and the response variable.


##### Conclusion: 

Overall, by performing the exploratory data analysis and regression analysis, we were able to handle the problem statement mentioned above. With the help of exploratory data analysis the first problem statement was resolved to identify the features that are impacting the overall house prices. Regression analysis helped to tackle second question wherein we need to predict the house price based on given features of house and property area. The Multiple Linear Regression model built to tackle second question on predicting house price and based on the result summary the model we built is statistically significant and predict house price.
After all, the above performed analysis on house price prediction helped to solve both of the business problems.
